# ObsidianReadwise

This application uses the Readwise.io API to push notes from a slipbox in Obsidian to a book in Readwise. The purpose being to re-surface slipbox notes to the user
using the spaced repitition process of Readwide.io. Once a slipbox note has been pushed to Readwise.io it is added to a list to prevent it from being synchronized
again.
